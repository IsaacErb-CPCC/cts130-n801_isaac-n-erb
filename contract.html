		<h2>Course Contract</h2>
		<p>
			I, <a href="introductions.html">Isaac N. Erb</a>, agree to abide by the terms in
			my <i>2024-Fall WEB115, Web Markup and Scripting</i>
			course with my instructor, D.I. von Briesen.
		</p>
		<p>
			I understand that all work that I do on my school and
			personal websites will be publicly available to the world.
			I will not put information there that is inappropriate for
			schoolwork, or that I wish to keep private.
		</p>
		<p>
			I also understand that it is my work that counts for
			attendance, not logins or showing up for class. As such,
			failure to turn in assignments may show as absences.
		</p>
		<p>
			Signed: <i>Isaac N. Erb, 13 August 2024</i>
